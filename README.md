# Music Maker

This is my attempt at making a web app for composing music

# Progress

Eventually this should be a fully-fledged music app, but below are the immediate steps for myself:

- [x] Add tap tempo
- [x] Add drum sound for tempo
- [ ] Add easy drum rhythm creation

# Getting started

You will need to run gulp, as I use ES6 syntax and imports

```
git clone https://github.com/joestrong/music-maker.git
cd music-maker
gulp scripts
gulp styles
```

You will also need to run a simple web server in the root folder
